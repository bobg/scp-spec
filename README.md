The repository for this document can be cloned from:

    git clone git@github.com:stanford-scs/scp-spec.git

To build the document, you either need
[mmark](https://github.com/miekg/mmark) and
[xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/) in your path, or go and
python pip in your path (in which case the makefile will build and
install the appropriate binaries into `$HOME/.cache/rfc`).  If you
want to clean up after building the documents, you will want to delete
both `$HOME/.cache/rfc` and `$HOME/.cache/xml2rfc`.

Instructions on the mmark input format (a markdown variant) are here:
